# HR Friendly Portfolio

We are developers/engineers. We make portfolios for other developers/engineers to see.

But while getting hired, HR managers are ones going thorugh our portfolios and they require something entirely different (something more corporate).

This is the starting point of an open source portfolio builder written in NextJS 14.

Fork it. Add your data. Host it on vercel.

### Suggestions

For each job you apply, have a different subdomain.

Example:

```swe.portfolio.com```, a portfolio for a software engineer role with matching projects, work exp description, etc

or

```webdev.portfolio.com```, a portfolio target toward a web dev role with relevant description, projects, etc.
